			<h2>Sales</h2>
			<p>Sales per square foot will vary from location to location and from store owner to storeowner based on many factors. The size of the community, general customer traffic of the shopping center, store location, proximity to the anchor, previous business ownership, management and merchandising experience of the owner, and personal daily involvement of the store owner are just a few examples of the variables that will determine your level of sales. The business skill and experience of each owner, along with the level of involvement in and commitment to their store will have an impact on their success.</p>
			<h2>Variable Costs</h2>
			<p><em>Variable costs are dependent on sales.  They are driven entirely by the amount of sales you are doing and are represented as a precentage of your sales.</em></p>
